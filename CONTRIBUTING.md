# I405 Contribution Guide

Follow the typical Github contribution flow:
1. Create an issue about what you want to work on so we can discuss it before you spend a lot of time working on it.
2. Fork the repo and create a branch. There's no strict naming scheme on branches.
3. Do the work.
4. Open a pull request.

Testing: Use `cargo test` to run the fast unit tests, which finish in under a second. There are also
a few slower integration tests, as well as end-to-end tests that actually run the I405 binaries. To
run these, first do a `cargo build` to actually generate the I405 debug binaries. Then, use `sudo -E
cargo test -- --include-ignored --test-threads` to run everything. Note that the E2E tests aren't
completely reliable and hence aren't included in CI.

I405-specific policies to be aware of:
+ LLM-generated code is permitted if it is clearly marked by a comment. That being said, LLMs were
  only used to help write tests in the initial I405 implementation, and even then sparingly because
  LLMs have a tendency to write tests that mirror the implementation. Please carefully read any code
  generated by an LLM.
+ LLM-generated documentation text is NOT permitted. Using LLMs to generate diagrams is permitted, I
  guess.
+ All tests, including E2E tests which you can run as described above, must pass.
+ Add tests for important parts of all "pure" behavior. Changes to the "hardware" implementations
  can be difficult to test (apart from e2e-tests), please describe what you've done to verify your
  implementation is correct because we don't test the hardware implementations (outside of the
  end-to-end test).
+ I405 is released under the MIT license. By opening a pull request you indicate that you are
  releasing your contribution under the MIT license also. No copyright assignment is required.
